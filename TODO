TODO List

Wishlist (for Digole)
------------------------

1) v3.0 does not allow for selecting the text position in graphics mode;
  this would allow placing text over an icon

2) Offscreen memory - high quality animations may be developed by allowing
  the MA command can be used for BitBLT by allow an offscreen address to
  be provided and a separate command to "carve up" ram into some number
  of slots (say 1KB/each). With 4KB ram you can have 4 slots!

  /* Load 4 bitmaps into memory and then cycle */

   for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      dd_bank_config(i, 1024); /* 4 banks of 1K */
   }

   /* Load 4 banks - we draw bitmap onscreen and copy offscreen*/
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
          draw_bitmap(0, 0, 16, 16, &img[i]);
	  dd_copy_area(ON2OFF, 0,  16, 16, i);
  }

  /* Loop forever copying off-screen to on-screen and affect animation */
  while(1) { 
  	  ++i %= 4;
	  dd_copy_area(OFF2ON, 0, 0,  16, 16, i);
  	   
  }

3) Faster baud rates, 1Mbaud would allow operation in 262K color mode
   for small glyphs

4) Documentation on how to connect RX to a UART. I plan to implement flash
   loading and firmware update
